# Fairness Audit and Mitigation

This project builds a fairness-aware machine learning pipeline to **detect** and **mitigate bias** in recruitment and decision-making datasets.  
It covers both the **diagnosis stage** (training models, running fairness reports) and the **treatment stage** (bias mitigation such as thresholding and reweighing).

## Project Structure
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks (exploration, experiments, results).  
- `src/` → Python scripts for preprocessing, models, and fairness metrics.  
- `docs/data-dictionaries/` → Data dictionaries for each dataset.

## Datasets Used
- IBM HR Analytics  
- Adult (Census Income)  
- Bias in Bios
